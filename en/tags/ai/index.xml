      <description>&lt;p&gt;I previously used Claude + Blender MCP for production work while I was employed at a company. Recently, as I restarted a personal project, I rebuilt the same environment—and this time, I decided to document the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most reference blogs are written for Windows setups, so this post is organized from the perspective of someone actually working on macOS, in a way that designers can realistically follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly good at 3D modeling. Even creating a single object used to take me two or three full days, and scene-level work took much longer. This approach was something I tried to compensate for those limitations and produce results more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
