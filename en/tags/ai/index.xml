      <title>Auto-summarizing YouTube videos with n8n &#43; Gemini</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which I save YouTube videos is always faster than the rate at which I can actually watch them. Research videos I&amp;rsquo;ve bookmarked, videos I&amp;rsquo;ve saved for later, links I copied because they might become references—they keep piling up. The bottleneck is time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most existing YouTube summarization tools rely on embedded subtitles, i.e., transcripts uploaded by the creator. If a video has no transcript, summarization becomes impossible. Videos without Korean subtitles, videos with low-quality auto-captions, or videos with no captions at all still require watching from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling Blender with AI: Claude MCP Setup Guide (Mac)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I previously used Claude + Blender MCP for production work while I was employed at a company. Recently, as I restarted a personal project, I rebuilt the same environment—and this time, I decided to document the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most reference blogs are written for Windows setups, so this post is organized from the perspective of someone actually working on macOS, in a way that designers can realistically follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly good at 3D modeling. Even creating a single object used to take me two or three full days, and scene-level work took much longer. This approach was something I tried to compensate for those limitations and produce results more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
